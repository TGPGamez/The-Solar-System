#Mercury
This is $name and is a $stateOfMatter planet, 
it is roughly $diameter kilometers in diameter and is a quite hot ($temperature degress Fahrenheit)


#Venus
This is $name and is a $stateOfMatter planet,
it is roughly $diameter kilometers in diameter and its very, very hot planet ($temperature degrees Fahrenheit).


#Earth
This is $name and it is a very nice, roundy planet, there is lot of life on it, the diameter is roughly $diameter kilometers in diameter
and the temperature is $temperature Fahrenheit.


#Mars
This is $name and it is roughly $diameter kilometers in diameter and its very cold planet ($temperature degress Fahrenheit).
​$name is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere and
also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.


#Jupiter
This is $name and it is roughly $diameter kilometers in diameter and very cold planet ($temperature degress Fahrenheit).
$name is called a $stateOfMatter planet. Its atmosphere is made up of mostly hydrogen gas and helium gas, like the sun. The planet is covered in thick red, brown, yellow and white clouds.
The clouds make the planet look like it has stripes. One of $name's most famous features is the Great Red Spot.


#Saturn
This is $name and is a $stateOfMatter planet made up mostly of hydrogen and helium. ($temperature degress Fahrenheit)
$name's volume is 76x bigger than Earth, and it is the second most massive planet in the solar system.
The Ringed Planet is the least dense of all the planets, and is the only one less dense than water.


#Uranus
This is $name and is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter ($diameter kilometers) in our solar system
and is $stateOfMatter planet that is coldest planet in our solar system ($temperature degress Fahrenheit).


#Neptune
This is $name and its like like Uranus, is an ice giant. It's similar to a $stateOfMatter.
It is made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane flowing over a solid core about the size of Earth. 
$name has a thick windy atmosphere. It's also a really cold planet ($temperature degress Fahrenheit).
